            <h2>Happy Halloween </h2>

            <p>Celebrated mostly in western countries, Halloween has different beliefs with respect to its origin.

Halloween means holy evening or All Saints Day. In the eighth century, All Saints Day was celebrated to honour saints. The eve of All Saints Day was called All Hallows Eve which then came to be known as Halloween.

It is also believed that Halloween originates from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain. In Ireland, Halloween was called Samhain which meant the end of summer. The festival was celebrated by people wearing spooky costumes and lighting bonfires at night. The tradition of donning a spooky attire was followed to keep ghosts away on 31 October. The night of 31 October was believed to be the night when spirits from the other world visited the living world every year.

The festival of Samhain marked the beginning of a cold winter and the end of the harvest season. This time of the year was also linked to death and decay. Hence, Celtic people celebrated Samhain on the boundary night of summer and winter by praying and lighting bonfires to ward off evil spirits.
